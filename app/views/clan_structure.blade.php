            <h3>Clan Structure</h3>

            UrTBD follows a strict internal clan structure for easy administration and management of itself. The
            following
            Figure represents the clan structure. <br/><br/>

            <strong>Clan Leaders</strong><br/>

            Top players, with combination of both skill and brain. They administrate, make changes, captain teams and
            represent
            the clan in international events.<br/><br/>

            <strong>Clan Seniors</strong><br/>

            Senior members, who moderate servers, view demos, make primary decisions about demos, train members and keep
            the
            clan on the move. <br/><br/>

            <strong>Clan Regulars</strong><br/>

            Recruits that survives two weeks of rigorous testing and evalutation, are later given this status of full
            membership.<br/><br/>

            <strong>Test Cases</strong><br/>

            New recruits, who're given a temporary membership of two weeks. However, upon the judgement of the Seniors,
            a
            player
            can be directly recruited as a Regular!<br/><br/>
