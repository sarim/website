            <h3>Join Us</h3>

            UrTBD has started recruiting members from all around the world. Applying for membership is easy and
            hassle-free!
            <br/><br/>

            The steps are quite simple:<br/><br/>

            <ol>
                <li>Apply for the membership</li>
                <li>Start playing regularly in our servers</li>
                <li>Follow the clan values</li>
            </ol>

            After we, the members of UrTBD get to know you, will give you a Test Case clan membership. This means you
            will
            be
            tested and observed for several weeks to see if you are worthy of being a member of our friendly clan. If
            you
            are
            good enough, some of our members might even recommend you! <br/><br/>

            What are you waiting for? Get Started! <br/><br/>
