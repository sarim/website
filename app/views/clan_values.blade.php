            <h3>Clan Values</h3>

            All UrTBD clan members are bound by these values and are expected to follow these rules in all games they
            play.
            If
            you are interested to becoming a member, we expect these values to be already present within you. <br/><br/>

            <strong>Respect</strong><br/>
            UrTBD is a gentlemen's clan. Regardless of how skilled a player is, UrTBD expects its members to be
            respectful
            towards other players whether he is winning or losing.<br/><br/>

            <strong>Honesty</strong><br/>
            Honesty is a must for all UrTBD members. No cheating is allowed. UrTBD clan follows a strict rule regarding
            this. If
            you feel that you are an 'Elite' because of your cheating tools, this makes you a real life loser. UrTBD is
            not
            for
            you.<br/><br/>

            <strong>Having Fun</strong><br/>
            Urban Terror is a game, and we want to keep it that way. We play for fun. Being a skilled player, and owning
            others
            is good, but that does not mean we can not get a good laugh while losing as well.
